Model Binding :
Model Binding is a process of mapping client request data to action method parameters.

client request data can be from various sources -> Body, Form, Header, Query String

Types :
FromForm
FromBody
FromQuery
FromHeader
FromRoute


Exclude prpoerties from model:
Using [JsonIgnore] above prpoerties in models
using other model/DTOs and mapping it to original model
Ex-> Employees table have columns : Id, Name, email, Salary, Age, Address
I want only each employee Name, Age, Salary
For that I can create EmployeeDTO
either we can do hardcode mapping or we can use Automapper-> 

Automapper setup :
Install Automapper Package
Create Automapper Profile
Register Automapper in Program.cs
Inject IMapper in controllers/classes where you want mapping
Map Objects Use the IMapper-> _mapper.Map<Destination_obj>(source_obj); to map bw objects
